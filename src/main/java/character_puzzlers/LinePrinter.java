/**
 * The line separator is the name given to the character or characters used to separate lines of text, and varies from
 * platform to platform. On Windows, it is the CR char- acter (carriage return) followed by the LF character
 * (linefeed).
 * On UNIX, it is the LF character alone, often referred to as the newline character. The following pro- gram passes
 * this character to println. What does it print? Is its behavior platform dependent?
 *
 * Hopefully, the last three puzzles have convinced you that Unicode escapes can be thoroughly confusing. The lesson is
 * simple: Avoid Unicode escapes except where they are truly necessary. They are rarely necessary.
