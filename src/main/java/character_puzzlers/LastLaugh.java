/**
 * The compiler evaluates the constant expression ’H’ + ’a’ by promoting each of the char-valued operands (’H’ and ’a’)
 * to int values through a process known as widening primitive conversion [JLS 5.1.2, 5.6.2].
 *
 * In summary, use the string concatenation operator with care. The + operator performs string concatenation if and only
 * if at least one of its operands is of type String; otherwise, it performs addition.
