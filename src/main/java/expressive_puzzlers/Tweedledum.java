/**
 * In other words, compound assignment expressions automatically cast the result of the computation they perform to the

 * cast has no effect.
 *
 * If, however, the type of the result is wider than that of the variable, the compound assignment
 * operator performs a <b>silent narrowing primitive conversion [JLS 5.1.3]</b>.
 * Attempting to perform the equivalent simple assignment would generate a compilation error, with good reason.
