/**
 * This program uses the compound assignment operator for exclusive OR. The tech- nique that it illustrates is part
 * of the programming folklore. What does it print?
 *
 * The lesson is simple: Do not assign to the same variable more than once in a single expression. Expressions
 * containing multiple assignments to the same variable are confusing and seldom do what you want. Even expressions that
 * assign to multiple variables are suspect. More generally, avoid clever programming tricks. They are bug-prone,
 * difficult to maintain, and often run more slowly than the straightforward code they replace [EJ Item 37].
