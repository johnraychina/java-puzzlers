 * Legal byte values range from  128 to +127, but the int constant 0x90 is equal to +144.
 * The comparison of a byte to an int is a mixed-type comparison.
 *
 * To summarize: Avoid mixed-type comparisons, because they are inher- ently confusing (Puzzle 5).
 * To help achieve this goal, use declared constants in place of “magic numbers.”
